This can lead to predictability in the generated numbers, which can be exploited by attackers to predict the behavior of the program, leading to security vulnerabilities.\n\nWeak or non-cryptographic random number generators do not provide a sufficient level of randomness and can produce predictable outcomes. They are not suitable for generating cryptographic keys or other sensitive data.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, use a strong cryptographic random number generator. In C++, you can use the `<random>` library, which provides a variety of random number generators. For cryptographic purposes, consider using a library specifically designed for cryptography, such as OpenSSL.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nHere is an example of how to use the `<random>` library to generate random numbers in C++:\n\n```cpp\n#include <random>\n\nstd::random_device rd;  // Will be used to obtain a seed for the random number engine\nstd::mt19937 gen(rd()); // Standard mersenne_twister_engine seeded with rd()\nstd::uniform_int_distribution<> distrib(1, 6);\n\nint random_number = distrib(gen);\n```\n\nIn this code, `std::random_device` is a uniformly-distributed integer random number generator that produces non-deterministic random numbers. `std::mt19937` is a Mersenne Twister random number generator, and `std::uniform_int_distribution` is a random number distribution that produces integers according to a uniform discrete distribution.\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe above code example requires the `<random>` library.\n\n## References\n\n- [CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak PRNG](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/338.html)"

This type of issue is a well-known source of subtle bugs and security vulnerabilities in C and C++ programs.\n\n## In Context Remediation\nTo prevent undefined behavior when the source and destination memory regions may overlap, replace the standard memory copy function with a function that is safe for overlapping regions. In C and C++, `memmove` is designed for this purpose. Replace the original memory copy call with `std::memmove(dst, src, byte_cnt)`. This ensures that the copy operation works correctly even if the source and destination overlap.\n\n```cpp\n// Replace this:\n// std::memcpy(dst, src, byte_cnt);\n\n// With this:\nstd::memmove(dst, src, byte_cnt);\n```\n\n## References\n- [OWASP: Buffer Overflow](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Buffer_Overflow)\n- [CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)\n- [CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html)\n- [C-Based Toolchain Hardening Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/C-Based_Toolchain_Hardening_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n\n___\n"

                "markdown": "## Description\n\n\"Detected Prohibited C Function\" vulnerability in C++ programming language refers to the use of certain C standard library functions that are known to be dangerous due to their potential to cause buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, or other problems. One such function is `printf`.\n\nThe `printf` function is a common function in C and C++ for outputting text. However, it can be dangerous if used improperly, especially when handling user-supplied input. This is because `printf` can interpret certain special characters (like `%s`, `%d`, etc.) and if an attacker can control the format string, they can potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code, read from or write to arbitrary memory locations, or cause the program to crash.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, avoid using `printf` with user-supplied input. Instead, use safer alternatives that do not interpret format strings, such as `puts` or `fputs`. If you need to format strings, use functions like `snprintf` that limit the amount of output, and always use a static format string.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nInstead of:\n\n```cpp\nchar* user_input = get_user_input();\nprintf(user_input);\n```\n\nUse:\n\n```cpp\nchar* user_input = get_user_input();\nputs(user_input);\n```\n\nOr, if you need to format strings:\n\n```cpp\nchar* user_input = get_user_input();\nchar buffer[256];\nsnprintf(buffer, sizeof(buffer), \"%s\", user_input);\nputs(buffer);\n```\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe code examples above require the following library:\n\n```cpp\n#include <stdio.h>\n```\n\n## References\n\n- [OWASP C++ Secure Coding Practices](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/C-Based_Toolchain_Hardening_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/676.html)"

This can lead to predictable randomness which can be exploited by an attacker to predict the outcome of the random number generator, leading to a potential security breach.\n\nNon-cryptographic random number generators are designed for statistical randomness, not unpredictability. They are often initialized with predictable seeds, such as the system time, making it easier for an attacker to guess the sequence of random numbers.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to use a cryptographically secure random number generator. In C++, this can be achieved using the `<random>` library which provides a variety of random number generators that are suitable for cryptographic use.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nAssuming `hip::detail::shuffle(var, src_lane, width)` is the vulnerable function, a potential fix could be to replace the random number generator used in this function with a cryptographically secure one. Here is an example of how to use a cryptographically secure random number generator in C++:\n\n```cpp\n#include <random>\n\nstd::random_device rd;\nstd::mt19937 gen(rd());\nstd::uniform_int_distribution<> dis(1, 6);\n\nint random_number = dis(gen);\n```\n\nIn this example, `std::random_device` is a non-deterministic random number generator, and `std::mt19937` is a Mersenne Twister pseudorandom generator of 32-bit numbers with a state size of 19937 bits.\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe above code example requires the `<random>` library.\n\n## References\n\n- [CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak PRNG](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/338.html)"

The classification explicitly states there is a risk of undefined behavior, and the verdict confirms this is a genuine issue. The analysis determined that the source and destination may overlap based on data flow, which can cause unpredictable results when using memory copy functions that do not support overlapping regions. There are no explicit checks or guards in the code to prevent this overlap, and the function does not use a safer alternative that handles overlapping memory. Both the source and destination are confirmed to be non-null, so the primary risk is the potential for memory overlap, which can lead to data corruption or crashes.\n\n## In Context Remediation\nTo prevent undefined behavior when the source and destination memory regions may overlap, replace the memory copy operation with a function that safely handles overlapping regions. In C++, use `std::memmove` instead of `std::memcpy`, as `std::memmove` is designed to handle overlapping memory correctly. For example, change the code to:\n\n```cpp\nstd::memmove(dst, src, width);\n```\n\nThis ensures that even if the source and destination regions overlap, the data will be copied safely without causing corruption or crashes.\n\n## References\n- [OWASP: Buffer Overflow](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Buffer_Overflow)\n- [CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)\n- [CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/120.html)\n\n\n___\n"
